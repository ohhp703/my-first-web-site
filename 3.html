<h2>Javascript</h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
technologies of the World Wide Web,
alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
often incorporating third-party libraries.
All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
